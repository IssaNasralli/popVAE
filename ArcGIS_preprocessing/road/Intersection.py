Intersection Density Calculation

    Open ArcGIS Pro:
        Launch ArcGIS Pro and open your project.

    Add Intersection Points:
        Ensure you have a shapefile containing points representing intersections of road segments. If not, import your intersection points data into ArcGIS Pro.

    Access the Point Density Tool:
        Navigate to the Analysis tab.
        Click on Tools to open the Geoprocessing pane.
        Search for Point Density tool and open it.

    Set Parameters in Point Density Tool:
        Input Point Features: Select the layer containing your intersection points.
        Population Field: Leave this as <None>, as you're not aggregating based on a specific field.
        Output Raster: Specify the location and name for the output raster file that will store the intersection density.
        Cell Size: Enter 100. This defines the size of each raster cell in meters.
        Neighborhood Settings:
            Shape: Choose Circle (or another appropriate shape for your analysis).
            Radius: Enter 500. This specifies the radius around each cell that will be used to calculate the density.
            Units: Select Map to ensure the radius is measured in map units (meters in your case).

    Area Units:
        If available, choose the appropriate area units for the output density calculation (e.g., Square Kilometers or Square Meters).

    Run the Tool:
        Once all parameters are set, click Run to execute the Point Density tool.
